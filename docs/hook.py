# This Python file contains hook functions for Trackma's engine signals.
# You can customize it freely to make Trackma do what you want after
# changes in your list have been made.
#
# These functions are called upon immediately by Trackma after the
# signal of the same name has been triggered. A reference to the Engine
# and the relevant arguments are also passed to the function.
# ===================================

# These functions are called when changes are made locally.
